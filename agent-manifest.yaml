  An ERC20 token contract keeps track of fungible tokens: any one token is exactly equal to any other token;
  no tokens have special rights or behavior associated with them. This makes ERC20 tokens useful for things
  like a medium of exchange currency, voting rights, staking, and more.

  Smart contracts are based on the Open Zeppelin reference implementation with AccessControl
  and Pause enhancements.
